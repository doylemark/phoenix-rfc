import InfoCard from "../../src/components/mdx/info-card";
import ToggleCard from "../../src/components/mdx/toggle-card";

We can use components here and write markdown here..

```
<InfoCard 
  level="warning" 
  title="Hey watchout this is a warning"
  message="this is a react component being rendered through markdown!"
/>
```
outputs:
<InfoCard 
  level="warning" 
  title="Hey watchout this is a warning"
  message="this is a react component being rendered through markdown!"
/>

We could write some more content and have an interactive component that will toggle between 2 components

```
<ToggleCard
  items={[
    {title: "installation", description: "some install instructions"},
    {title: "usage", description: "other interesting usage instructions"}
  ]}
/>
```
<ToggleCard
  items={[
    {title: "installation", description: "some install instructions"},
    {title: "usage", description: "other interesting usage instructions"}
  ]}
/>
This lets us create very powerful patterns and lets us inject logic into our content
